## A statement of the overall goal / research question
In this project, I am going to analyze data about Alzheimer's disease. My data of this project is from an essay about Knowledge and status of Alzheimer's disease in China in 2022. 

Early prevention of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for establishing and improving health services for the elderly. I hope my analysis would be helpful.

In my analysis, I will summarize and visualize these data to study the awareness of AD in China.
